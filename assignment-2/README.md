## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User enters a **blog URL**
2. Clean blog text is sent to an **n8n webhook**
3. **n8n** uses **HTTP Request node** to output the html document of the blog and **Gemini** to clean the document, and then **jscode** for summarizing.
4. Summary is returned to frontend and optionally saved in **Supabase**
5. Full Content of blog is saved in **MongoDB**.

summaries â€“ stores blog URL, summary text, user ID, and timestamp
